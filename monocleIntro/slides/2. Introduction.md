## Introduction

Today presentation is about Optics - a set of functional concepts used to focus into immutable objects. 
In particular, I am going to present how they are defined in Monocle but it should be general enough to 
be applicable to other Scala libraries (Scalaz, Shapeless) or other languages (e.g. Lens in Haskell).

I heard about Lens for the first time over 1 year and half ago, the concept seemed interesting but
at that time I couldn't find an easy to use library in Scala. Then at Scala eXchange last year (2013), Symon Peyton Jones
gave a presentation about Haskell Lens implementation. He is an excellent speaker but I had to watched the video 2-3 times
before I managed to put my head around.
