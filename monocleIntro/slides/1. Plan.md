## Optics

##### What are Optics
Set of functional abstractions to manipulate (get, set, modify) immutable objects. 
Define how to focus into part of a structure
Define common api to update structure (e.g. case class, List, Map)

#### Goal
Make you identify Optics relationship in your daily work

#### Part 1: Lens 
define how to zoom to a mandatory present smaller part
applicable to: all product types, e.g. case class, tuples, HList, Record

#### Part 2: Prism
define how to zoom into an optional part, if present it fully describe the original object
applicable to: all sum types, e.g. Option, Either, Json, sealed trait

#### Part 3: Optional / Traversal
define how to zoom into an 0-1 (for Optional) or 0-n (for Traversal)
a completely valid Traversal/Optional/Prism is one that zoom to nothing, however when it does zoom to something, they offer different guantee



#### Conclusion
Optics are like Monad, Functor and other functional concepts.
