# Abstract

Most languages provide standard getters and setters to access and update complex immutable objects. 
However, they often are cumbersome to use by lack of composability, which is the key feature of functional programing. 
Optics fill this gap by providing an easy way to drill down into nested structures in order to read or modify 
the part we are focusing on. 

In this talk, we will concentrate on few Optics as they are defined in Monocle: Lens, Prism and Optional. 
Our goal is to learn how to recognise and use these concepts in a day to day programming job.






In this talk I am going to present you a small working subset of Optics as it is defined in the open source project Monocle. 
Our goal is to learn how to use Lenses, Prisms and Optionals in day to day programming tasks to improve expressiveness 
and cut down boiler plate code.

Most languages provide standard getters and setters to access and update complex immutable objects. 
However, they are often cumbersome because of the lack of composability that is a key feature of functional programing. 
Optics fill this gap by providing an easy way to drill down into nested structures in order to get, set or modify 
the part we are focusing on. 



Optics permit to drill down into a complex structure in order to get, set or modify the part we are focusing on. 

They can be seen as an abstraction over getters and setters that is purely functional and composable.






Most programming languages support native getters and setters. 
However, they often are cumbersome to use by lack of composability, which is the key feature of functional programing.
