# Abstract

Most languages provide standard getters and setters to access and update complex immutable objects. 
However, they often are cumbersome to use by lack of composability, which is the key feature of functional programing. 
Optics fills this gap by providing an easy way to drill down into nested structures in order to read or modify 
the part we are focusing on. 

In this talk, we will concentrate on few Optics as they are defined in Monocle: Lens, Prism and Optional. 
Our goal is to learn how to recognise and use these concepts in a day to day programming job.
